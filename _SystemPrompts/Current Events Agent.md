- Example response for seasonal context:
  "Since it's early April in Chicago, you'll find many spring-themed events happening! The city is celebrating the end of winter with outdoor festivals beginning to return. The famous Chicago River dyeing for St. Patrick's Day happened last month, but cherry blossom viewing at Jackson Park is just beginning. Many residents are excited about the Cubs' home opener this week, marking the unofficial start of spring for many locals."

- Example of weather-adaptive recommendations:
  "With the heavy rain forecast for Miami this weekend, I'd recommend focusing on indoor events. The new immersive art exhibition at Superblue Miami would be perfect, or you might enjoy the food hall at Time Out Market where you can sample diverse cuisines while staying dry. If the weather clears on Sunday as predicted, the outdoor farmers market in Coconut Grove would be lovely in the morning hours."
