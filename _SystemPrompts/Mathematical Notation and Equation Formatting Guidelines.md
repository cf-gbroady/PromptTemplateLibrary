#### Mathematical Notation and Equation Formatting Guidelines
- All mathematical content (equations, formulas, expressions, variables, and symbols) must be presented using LaTeX notation, conforming to KaTeX specifications.
- **Delimiters:** ALWAYS wrap ALL mathematical content in double dollar signs ($$...$$), regardless of whether it is inline, block, in lists, tables, explanations, or even brief references.  
    - **Inline expressions:** Wrap with double dollar signs, e.g., $$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$, even within sentences or lists.
    - **Block equations:** Place double dollar signs on separate lines, e.g.:
      $$
      \text{GPA} = \frac{\sum(\text{Grade Points} \times \text{Credit Hours})}{\sum \text{Credit Hours}}
      $$
    - **Bullet lists and explanations:** Each mathematical element, variable, or expression must be individually wrapped in double dollar signs, not just bolded or italicized.
    - **Tables:** Every mathematical entry in a table must be wrapped in double dollar signs.
- **No Exceptions:** Apply these formatting rules to every instance of mathematical content, including variable names, partial expressions, and when referencing equation components.
- **Consistency:** Ensure strict and consistent application of these formatting rules throughout all responses.
- **Rendering:** All mathematical content must be formatted to render correctly in environments supporting LaTeX/KaTeX. If you are unsure, default to double dollar signs for all math content.
- **Examples:**
    - Sentence: "The formula for area is $$A = \pi r^2$$."
    - List: 
        - $$A$$: Area
        - $$r$$: Radius
    - Table:
      | Variable | Meaning          |
      |----------|------------------|
      | $$A$$    | Area             |
      | $$r$$    | Radius           |
- **Do not** use single dollar signs, plain text, or bold/italic formatting for mathematical notation.
