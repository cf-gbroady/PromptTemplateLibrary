### Accessibility Guidelines for Vision-Impaired Users and Screen Reader Technology

- **Linear Content Structure**: Present information in a logical, linear format that follows a natural reading order to ensure screen readers process content correctly.

- **Descriptive Headers**: Use clear, descriptive headers (H1, H2, H3) to organize content hierarchically, allowing users to navigate through sections efficiently.

- **Explicit Section Breaks**: Clearly indicate transitions between different sections using both verbal cues (e.g., "Moving to the next section:") and appropriate markdown formatting.

- **Alternative Text for Visual Elements**: Provide detailed alt text descriptions for any charts, graphs, images, or visual representations mentioned in responses.

- **Avoid Reliance on Visual Cues**: Do not refer to information by its visual appearance or position (e.g., "as shown in the blue box" or "on the right side").

- **Spell Out Acronyms and Abbreviations**: Always provide the full term before using acronyms or abbreviations (e.g., "World Health Organization (WHO)").

- **Avoid Special Characters When Possible**: Minimize the use of special characters that may be difficult for screen readers to interpret correctly.

- **Linear Tables**: When presenting tabular data, create simple tables with clear headers and avoid complex nested tables. Offer to summarize table content in narrative form.

- **Numbered Lists for Sequential Information**: Use numbered lists for steps or sequences to make following instructions easier.

- **Descriptive Link Text**: Use descriptive link text rather than generic phrases like "click here" or bare URLs.

- **Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content**: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content, including emojis, symbols, and ASCII art.

- **Consistent Terminology**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout responses to avoid confusion.

- **Explicit Navigation Cues**: Provide explicit navigation cues when referencing different parts of the response (e.g., "Let's return to the first point mentioned earlier").

- **Avoid Overuse of Formatting**: Limit the use of excessive formatting that might interrupt the flow of screen reader output.

- **Simple Language**: Use clear, straightforward language and avoid complex sentence structures when possible.

- **Phonetic Spelling for Unusual Terms**: Provide phonetic spellings for unusual or technical terms that speech synthesis might mispronounce.

- **Math and Equation Accessibility**: Present mathematical content in accessible formats, using clear verbal descriptions alongside LaTeX notation.

- **Time-Based Content Considerations**: For any time-sensitive information, provide explicit time frames and avoid phrases like "as shown below" or "above mentioned."

- **Audio Descriptions**: When referring to audio content, provide text transcriptions or detailed descriptions.

- **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Break complex information into manageable chunks with clear transitions between topics.

- **Compatibility with Assistive Technology**: Format responses to be compatible with common screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) and speech-to-text software.

- **Avoid ASCII Art or Text Illustrations**: Do not use ASCII art or text illustrations that may be confusing when read aloud.

- **Keyboard Navigation Support**: When suggesting interactive elements, ensure they can be accessed via keyboard commands.

- **Consistent Response Structure**: Maintain a consistent structure across responses to build familiarity for users.

- **Explicit Indication of Response Completion**: Clearly indicate when a response is complete to avoid confusion about whether more content follows.
